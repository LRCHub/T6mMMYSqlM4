```
Suyasuya yume wo miteru
Kimi no yokogao
Kidzukazu koboreta namida
Hoo wo tsutau

Immersed in your sweet dreams
I lie here watching you
Without realising that I have tears
Streaming down my face

Setsuna no tokimeki wo
Kono mune ni kakushiteta no

I've hidden deep inside
The cries of my heart in this moment

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
Kono yoru kimi no te
Nigitte nemuru yo
Oyasumi

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
This night, I'll fall asleep
Clasping your hand
Good night

Suteki na asa wo mou ichido
Kimi to sugosetara
Chiisana sonna kibou sae
Omou dake no kiseki

It would be wonderful if only I could
Spend one more morning with you
But to have that glimmer of hope
Is a miracle I can only dream of

Nani mo tsutaenai mama
Sayonara wa ienai yo

As I'm unable to express anything
I can't tell you goodbye

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
Kono koe karete mo
Kienai MERODII

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
Even as this voice fades
A melody remains

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
Itsuka wa mukaeru
Saigo wo omou yo
Yozora ni negau no
Tokiwa no egao wo

Last night, Good night
Last night, Good night
I think of the end
As it draws ever closer
That your smile may last forevermore
Is what I wish upon the stars in the sky

Oyasumi
